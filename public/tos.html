    <section>
      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using Ⲱⲟⲩⲛⲓⲁⲧⲕ (“the Service”), you agree to comply with these Terms of Service and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Ⲱⲟⲩⲛⲓⲁⲧⲕ: Coptic AI. These Terms govern your access to and use of our platform, tools, and services. We seek to provide an insightful, ethical, and faith-aligned experience. Please read carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Age Restrictions</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 16 years old to use the Service. If you are under 16, you may only use the Service with parental consent. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (COPPA compliance).
      </p>

      <h2>4. Use of the Service</h2>
      <p>
        You may use this Service solely for interacting with AI tools that provide religious, cultural, and educational insights. The Service does not facilitate communication between users, and no user-generated public content is hosted or displayed. You agree not to misuse the Service or engage in prohibited conduct.
      </p>

      <h2>5. User Account Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.
      </p>

      <h2>6. User Conduct and Prohibited Uses</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service to engage in hate speech, harassment, discrimination, or any form of abuse.</li>
        <li>Upload or distribute content that is unlawful, offensive, defamatory, or infringes on others' rights.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or disrupt the Service.</li>
        <li>Use the Service in ways that violate Coptic Orthodox faith principles or promote harmful behavior.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. User Content</h2>
      <p>
        No user content is publicly posted or shared. User inputs are processed in real time by AI models solely to generate responses. You retain any rights in your input, but you understand it may be temporarily processed or logged by third-party services (e.g., YesChat) to deliver results. We do not publish or store your content beyond operational requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All intellectual property rights in the Service and its content, including trademarks and copyrights, belong to Ⲱⲟⲩⲛⲓⲁⲧⲕ or its licensors. You agree not to copy, distribute, or create derivative works without permission.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        Your use of the Service is subject to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains what data we collect and how we protect your privacy. We comply with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR (EU) and CCPA (California).
      </p>

      <h2>10. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your personal data only as long as necessary to provide the Service or comply with legal obligations. You may request deletion of your data by contacting us.
      </p>

      <h2>11. AI Use and Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        This Service uses third-party artificial intelligence systems to generate responses. These systems process your input in real time and produce text based on learned data patterns. While efforts are made to ensure accurate and appropriate responses, the output may not reflect official Coptic doctrine or professional advice. Please consult clergy or trusted sources for religious decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is powered by third-party providers such as YesChat and Thoth AI, which may process inputs to return responses. These services operate under their own terms and privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them before use. While we select partners aligned with our faith and ethical standards, we do not control their data handling.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Limitations of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, Ⲱⲟⲩⲛⲓⲁⲧⲕ is not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no internet transmission can be guaranteed as 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Changes to Terms and Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. When changes are material, we will notify you via email or through the Service. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>16. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the European Union and the United States, depending on your location. Any disputes shall be resolved in competent courts within your jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h2>17. Contact Information</h2>
      <p>
        For questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:jacob.h.abraham@gmail.com">jacob.h.abraham@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>18. No User Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        This platform is designed exclusively for users to interact with AI systems. No chat, messaging, or content exchange between users is supported or permitted. All inputs are private and processed only by the AI backend in a one-to-one context.
