When the meal was ended, the brother brought him some water for rinsing his hands and Saint Basil said to him, \"Come here, so that I also may offer you water.\" The brother allowed the bishop to pour the water. Then Saint Basil said to him, \"When I enter the sanctuary, come, that I may ordain you deacon.\" When this was done, he ordained him priest and took him with him to the bishop's palace because of his obedience.'"

I even poured some into a leather bottle for fear of being thirsty later on. Seeing this, the old man asked me why I was taking some. I said to him, \"Forgive me, it is for fear of being thirsty later on.\" Then the old man said, \"God is here, God is everywhere.\"'"

When the time of harvest came again, the brothers brought what was left to the church. For my own part, I had not uncorked my vessel but had taken a little by piercing it with a stiletto, imagining in my heart that I had achieved something splendid. But when the brothers brought their plaster vessels as they were while mine was pierced, I was as ashamed as though I had committed fornication.'"
