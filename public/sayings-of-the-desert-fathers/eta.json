He told him the following in order to comfort him: 'An old man had a disciple who for many years had obeyed him in everything. Now one day when he was attacked by the devil, he made a prostration before the old man, saying, \"Let me become a monk on my own.\" The old man replied, \"Survey the district and we will build a cell for you.\" So they found a place a mile away. They went there and built the cell. The old man said to the brother, \"What I tell you to do, do it. Each time you are afflicted, eat, drink, sleep; only do not come out of your cell until Saturday; then come to see me.\" The brother spent two days according to these orders, but the third day, a prey to accidie, he said to himself, \"Why did the old man arrange that for me?\" Standing up, he sang many psalms, and after sunset he ate, then went to lie down on his mat to sleep. But he saw an Ethiopian lying there who gnashed his teeth at him. Driven by great fear, he ran to the old man, knocked on his door and said, \"Abba, have pity on me, open the door.\" The old man, seeing he had not obeyed his instructions did not open it till morning, very early; then he opened it, and found him outside imploring him to help him. Then, full of pity, he made him come inside. The other said, \"Father, I need you; on my bed I saw a black Ethiopian, as I was going to sleep.\" The old man replied, \"You suffered that because you did not keep to my instructions.\" Then, according to his capacity, he taught him the discipline of the solitary life, and in a short time he became a good monk.'"
